# CS50.py
This repository contains my solutions to python pset6 of CS50 2020. I used them to acquire knowledge. Therefore, they are sometimes more interactive, or just structured in a specific way, thus not always the simplest solution to the problem. 
They can be used as a hint, please do not use them as a copy paste solution to submit.
