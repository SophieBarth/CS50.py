# CS50.py
The repository contains my solutions to python psets of CS50. I used them to acquire knowledge, thus they are sometimes more interactive, responsive, or just structured in a specific way; thus not the simplest solution to the problems. 
They can be used as a hint, not as a copy paste solution to submit.
